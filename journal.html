<h3>Week 2 - Lesson 1</h3> - This week was really frusterating to try to figure out what excatly we are supposed to do in this class. The instructions are vague at best and the teacher is often contradicting what iLearn says. I researched my first lesson topics and build a page to display my competencies. I really hope it will meetthe teacher's standards. It took me an entire day, over 8 hours, to build the site. I couldn't get the pages to link back and forth the way I wanted but I finally got it to work. When I met the second time this week with my team I was glad that they were so impressed.<br>
<h3>Week 3 - Lesson 2</h3> - I am still not exactly sure what I should submit. It freaked me out to see that my ggrade was an F in the class so far. Hopefully I can get at least an 8.5 in each area then go back and fix them all to get the higher points. I had a hard time staying motivated to get the work done. Hopefully I can do better next week. <br>
<h3>Week 4 - Lesson 3</h3> - This week was really frusterating. I feel like I don't know enough to learn the new concepts. When we met as a group some the of terms they use are way over my head. This week I followed the coding examples I saw online and couldn't get it to work. I worked on it for hours and hours. I started on the next section and it was way over my head. I went back to learn the basics of XML so I could understand how it works with JSON. It ws a crazy week for me personally as well. Hopefully things go better next week.<br>
<h3>Week 5</h3> - This week I was a litle out of my leagure. I really wish I had more experience before taking this class. I am going to push forward and do the best I can, but I am running into a lot of problems with my code because I am making assumptions based on my limited experience but since there is not much there, I am running into a lot of bugs and I don't know how to work around them.<br>
<h3>Week 6</h3> - I added CSS to indicate code that had been fixed or changed. Lesson 1 needs to be reevaluated, lesson 4 has been fixed and now works awesome. All of lesson 5 JS has been fixed and now works amazingly! I also did lesson 7 which was adjusting classes wih JavaScript, which changed what they did in CSS <br>
<h3>Week 7</h3> - This week I presented on topic 8. I also completed pages for 8, 9 and 10. I will teach 9 and 10 next week. I need to go back and do lesson 6 then go on to do lesson 11,12,13. I really hope things go well with my scores this week! All of my code works with examples, but there is less just text descriptions.
