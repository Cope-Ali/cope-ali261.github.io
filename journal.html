Week 2 - Lesson 1 - This week was really frusterating to try to figure out what excatly we are supposed to do in this class. The instructions are vague at best and the teacher is often contradicting what iLearn says. I researched my first lesson topics and build a page to display my competencies. I really hope it will meetthe teacher's standards. It took me an entire day, over 8 hours, to build the site. I couldn't get the pages to link back and forth the way I wanted but I finally got it to work. When I met the second time this week with my team I was glad that they were so impressed.
Week 3 - Lesson 2 - I am still not exactly sure what I should submit. It freaked me out to see that my ggrade was an F in the class so far. Hopefully I can get at least an 8.5 in each area then go back and fix them all to get the higher points. I had a hard time staying motivated to get the work done. Hopefully I can do better next week.
